## My process
HTML:
- Set up the skeleton of the page based on the example
-Give an ID to each component for clarity(Idk how necessary is this)
CSS:
- Adjust the alignment and placement of all elements using Flexbox (I have done proper research on flexbox by watching a couple of youtube videos)
- Implemented the active version for the blog card
- Adjusted the text font, size and weight accordingly
- Adjusted the profile pic image and the name
Things left to do:
- I still do not know how to design it with both mobile and web versions in mind, in my next project I will be focusing on this
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
### What I learned

I have a better understanding of Flexbox as a tool now. I learnt what svg files are, what viewbox and viewport entail. I learnt about box-shadow from checking other solutions to the problem

### Continued development

- Understand how to structure my HTML elements better
- Learn more about different displays and apply them, like gridbox and inline
- I want to be able to do this faster next time

### Useful resources

- [SVG explanation series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJSCl6XEdP8) - These series helped explain SVG elements for me, I watched up to the 4th video to get a basic understanding of what I was dealing with. It introduced me to good concepts like Viewport and viewbox
- [Understanding CSS grid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phWxA89Dy94) - This is a great video explaing Flexbox basics. It was a great start to understand how the box aligned and how to control them and play aorund with them
